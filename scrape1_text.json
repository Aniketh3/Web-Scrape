        "Introduction": {
            "General": [
                "Nuclear fission is a fundamental process in nuclear physics where the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller fragments, releasing a significant amount of energy. This phenomenon is pivotal in both energy production and the development of nuclear weapons. Understanding nuclear fission is essential for students of the International Baccalaureate (IB) Physics Standard Level (SL) curriculum, providing foundational knowledge for advanced studies in nuclear and quantum physics."

        "Key Concepts": {
            "Definition of Nuclear Fission": [
                "Nuclear fission is the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, absorbs a neutron and becomes unstable. This instability causes the nucleus to split into two lighter nuclei, known as fission fragments, along with the release of additional neutrons and a substantial amount of energy."
            ],
            "Mechanism of Fission": [
                "The fission process begins when a nucleus captures a neutron, leading to a compound nucleus in an excited state. For instance, when uranium-235 ($^{235}U$) absorbs a neutron ($n$), it forms uranium-236 ($^{236}U$) in an excited state:",
                "The asterisk (*) denotes the excited state, which is unstable and prone to splitting. The compound nucleus de-excites by splitting into two smaller nuclei, such as barium-141 ($^{141}Ba$) and krypton-92 ($^{92}Kr$), along with the release of additional neutrons and energy:\n$$\n^{236}U^* \\rightarrow ^{141}Ba + ^{92}Kr + 3^{1}n + \\text{Energy}\n$$"
            ],
            "Energy Release in Fission": [
                "The energy released during nuclear fission primarily arises from the difference in binding energy between the reactants and the products. Binding energy per nucleon is higher in the fission fragments compared to the original heavy nucleus, resulting in the release of energy. This energy manifests as kinetic energy of the fission fragments, emitted neutrons, and electromagnetic radiation."
            ],
            "Chain Reactions": [
                "A critical aspect of nuclear fission is the possibility of a chain reaction. The neutrons released during fission can induce further fission events in adjacent nuclei. For a sustained chain reaction, at least one of the emitted neutrons must trigger another fission event. This concept is foundational in both nuclear reactors and atomic bombs."
            ],
            "Critical Mass": [
                "The concept of critical mass is central to sustaining a chain reaction. Critical mass is the minimum amount of fissile material needed to maintain a self-sustaining chain reaction. Factors affecting critical mass include the type of fissile material, its purity, shape, and the presence of a neutron reflector. For example, the critical mass of $^{235}U$ is approximately 52 kilograms in a spherical shape without a reflector."
            ],
            "Neutron Moderators and Absorbers": [
                "In nuclear reactors, neutron moderators and absorbers play vital roles in controlling the rate of the chain reaction. Moderators, such as water or graphite, slow down the fast neutrons produced during fission, increasing the likelihood of further fission events. Absorbers, or control rods made of materials like cadmium or boron, capture excess neutrons to regulate the reaction rate and prevent runaway scenarios."
