By analyzing the forces exerted by gas molecules on the container walls, Boyle's Law can be derived by equating the pressure to the product of force and area.\n\nFor example, the pressure exerted by a gas can be expressed as:\n$$P = \\frac{F}{A}$$\nwhere F is the force and A is the area.\n\nIf the volume decreases by a factor of 2 (V/2), then, maintaining temperature, pressure will double to fulfill $P \\propto 1/V$.\n\nIn terms of Avogadro's Law, the number of molecules (n) directly impacts the pressure and volume. This is essential in calculations involving the molar volume of gases at standard temperature and pressure (STP), where one mole of an ideal gas occupies approximately 22.4 liters."

Suppose a sample of gas at 2.0 atm and 600 K occupies 4.0 liters. If the pressure decreases to 1.0 atm and the temperature is reduced to 300 K, what is the new volume?\n\nUsing the combined gas law:\n$$\\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}$$\n$$\\frac{2.0 \\times 4.0}{600} = \\frac{1.0 \\times V_2}{300}$$\n$$\\frac{8.0}{600} = \\frac{V_2}{300}$$\nSolving for $V_2$:\n$$V_2 = \\frac{8.0 \\times 300}{600} = 4.0 \\text{ L}$$"
