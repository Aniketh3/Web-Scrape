If a region receives an annual precipitation of 1,000 mm, with 30% infiltrating into the groundwater, and the area is 10,000 square kilometers, the annual groundwater recharge (\\(R\\)) can be calculated as:\n$$R = \\text{Precipitation} \\times \\text{Infiltration Rate} \\times \\text{Area}$$\n$$R = 1,000 \\text{ mm/year} \\times 0.3 \\times 10,000 \\text{ km}^2$$\nConverting units:\n$$1,000 \\text{ mm} = 1 \\text{ m}$$\n$$10,000 \\text{ km}^2 = 10,000 \\times 10^6 \\text{ m}^2 = 10^{10} \\text{ m}^2$$\nThus,\n$$R = 1 \\text{ m/year} \\times 0.3 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ m}^2 = 3 \\times 10^9 \\text{ m}^3/\\text{year}$$"
